Hello Professor,

This week for homework I made a simplistic sequencer.
It's essentially a one-bar loop made of 8-th notes.

There's an 8 by 8 array of buttons that can be turned on/off.
The algorithm cycles through columns at the speed of 8-th notes and checks whichever buttons on a chosen column are on.
When on, the buttons play a sound of higher or lower pitch depending on their placement in the column (higher up = higher pitch).

Left-click a button to turn it on.
Right-click it to turn it off.

I put comments inside the code to explain the usage of involved functions and variables.
